                  This same exact system is the reason I was able to generate
                  over $700,000 in my agency to date, that number is constantly
                  increasing because I actually still run a successful agency -

                </p>
                <p>
                  And I did it without having to prospect for leads, do sales
                  calls, create proposals, manually follow up with clients,
                  fulfill services myself or manage and talk to any of our
                  clients…
