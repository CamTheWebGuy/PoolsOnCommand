        <br />
        The average person who buys any “how to” information gets little to no
        results. I’m using these references for example purposes only.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your results will vary and depend on many factors …including but not
        limited to your background, experience, and work ethic.
        <br />
        <br />
        All business entails risk as well as massive and consistent effort and
        action.{' '}

        everything setup, configured and going…

        ...But once up and running - I’m able to oversee the whole operation
        with very little time and work on my part.

      </p>
      <p className='fsize-20'>
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 1
        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner gets a lead (someone who is interested in their service)
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 2
        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner needs to know what the prospect wants, so they eventually
        manage to get into a meeting or phone call after some back-and-forth to
        figure out scheduling
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 3
        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner agrees to summarize what was discussed, and “get back to
        you with a proposal"
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 4
        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner spends hours perfecting a proposal which he is very
        nervous to send out because he now realizes that he was too afraid to
        talk about prices, and this proposal will most certainly come as a shock
        to the prospect because of the high price
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>

        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner sends proposal

        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 6
        </strong>{' '}
        - Prospect is shocked at the high price
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 7
        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner wonders why he hasn’t heard back, it’s been 5 days since
        he sent the proposal
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 8
        </strong>{' '}
        - Agency owner follows up via email
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 9
        </strong>{' '}
        - Prospect deflects with something along the lines of “just need to
        discuss with my team"
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 10
        </strong>{' '}
        - Repeat step 8 and 9 a few times
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 11
        </strong>{' '}
        - The whole thing fizzles out, and tens of hours end up being completely
        wasted, leading nowhere
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <i className='fa fa-times-circle color-red2'></i>
          &nbsp; Step 12

        … And I’d just graduated college at the peak of the global financial
        crisis.
        <br />
        <br />
        I couldn’t get an interview to save my life, even with 2 degrees.
        <br />
        <br />
        That’s when I realized that the university had been an absolute complete
        waste of time and money.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          There’s a stupid myth out there..that if you just go to college, get a
          job, everything will work out…
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        … Well sometimes it doesn’t..
        <br />
        <br />
        And if you want a life of freedom, fun and adventure university is
        almost never the answer...
        <br />
        <br />
        I know, because I tried.
        <br />
        <br />
        I gave it everything I had.
        <br />
        <br />
        I gave it my BEST shot.
        <br />
        <br />
        And it didn’t work.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because I played by the rules and I did everything right...

      <p className='fsize-20'>
        I hated it because I knew if I stayed there - that job would become my
        identity and all my hopes, goals and dreams would be put aside to
        fulfilling my role in that job.
        <br />

        I started looking for a way out.

        I looked everywhere and a a few months later I found it.
        <br />
        <br />
        I stumbled upon a forum where a group of guys and gals were talking
        about how they were "digital nomads" traveling the world and funding
        their freedom lifestyles by "freelancing online".
        <br />
        <br />
        This was a cool concept to me, and as I researched more and more I found
        that most of these freelancers were working for digital agencies.
        <br />
        <br />
        I didn't have the skills to be a "freelancer" so I decided to just
        create my own digital agency.

        And That Was The Birth Of My Digital Agency

      <p className='fsize-20'>
        After doing a bit of research - I started a digital agency providing
        video animation services to businesses in my home country of Sweden.
        <br />
        <br />
        I had no idea how to do any of the video services myself, but that was
        ok since I found a few freelancers who could do the services for me.
        <br />
        <br />
        All I had to do was know how to sell the service.

        Looking back, those first 3 years of my agency life were br/utal...

        60-80 hour weeks.

        <strong>
          <u>Here’s why:</u>
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are two types of agency owners out there.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are the "freelancers" and there are "business owners".
        <br />
        <br />
        For my first 3 years of running my agency - I was a glorified
        freelancer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Freelancers are always out there trying to line up the next deal so they
        can make a quick buck.
        <br />
        <br />
        Their strategy is to try to get all of the money up front.

        All of this requires time and energy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The problem isn't the model itself as it's the fact that as your
        freelancer agency grows, so does your workload...
        <br />
        <br />
        ...On one hand, you're focused on getting new business and on the other
        hand you're too busy fulfilling the projects you've taken on.
        <br />
        <br />
        And as a result - this eventually becomes a job.
        <br />
        <br />
        But not just any job - a job you're stuck in and can never leave.
        <br />
        <br />
        And this is the same exact thing that happened to me before I figured

        So here's the $700,000 idea behind the 2 Hour Agency Model
      </h3>
      <p className='fsize-20'>
        {' '}
        Right now, as you're reading this very page...
        <br />
        <br />
        There's a lot of activity happening in the world of business.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          <em>The internet has changed everything</em>
        </strong>{' '}
        - for <u>everyone</u> - businesses have to adopt to the latest and
        greatest technological advances or lose to those that do.
        <br />
        <br />
        This has created a massive demand for digital agencies to fulfill this
        massive need in the business ecosystem.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, most of these businesses are looking for services now...
        <br />
        <br />
        And as you may have guessed it - business owners like to save money.
        <br />
        <br />
        So when they find a service provider, they rather spend $500 vs $2,000.
        <br />
        <br />
        And what's really cool is that they'll gladly spend that $500 right on
        the web site that doesn't require any interaction, proposals,
        prospecting or anything.{' '}
      </p>
      <h3 className='landing__sl-heading color-red text-center pdding-btm-30'>
        That's Right - given a choice they rather spend $500 on a web site than
        $2,000 going Thought he Traditional agency process

      <p className='fsize-20'>
        {' '}
        And that's where the 2 Hour Agency comes in...
        <br />
        <br />
        It does this beautifully in 6 easy steps...{' '}

        {' '}
        <strong>
          {' '}
          <u>And that’s the difference here. </u>
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        When you setup your digital agency using this model a sale in your sleep
        means it is something we can replicate and scale up.
        <br />
        <br />
        A sale acquired manually by YOU is going to be limited by your input,
        and you only have 24 hours in a day.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m not saying high prices are bad.
        <br />
        <br />
        What I’m saying if your goal is freedom, high prices might actually be
        the thing that’s holding you back from getting it!
        <br />
        <br />
        High prices require prospecting, meetings, phone calls, proposals, and
        follow up.
        <br />
        <br />
        Low-medium just require a kickass website (with the right formula)!
        <br />
        <br />
        And that's why this is different, because it work for you and turns your
        agency into a business.{' '}

        <br />
        Getting new clients, selling your services, and full-filing your

        <u>The truth is...</u>

        I was planning on selling this book for $47, but that meant I had to
        print copies of it, store them and ship them.
        <br />
        <br />

              Like my grandpa used to say “Test drive the car before you drive
              it off the lot”… So here’s what I’ve arranged: Download the eBook,
              read it out, but more importantly apply what you learn in there.
              And if you’re not blown away by what you learn. Then just shoot me
              an email and request a refund within 30 days. We’ll refund you
              your $5.60 and let you keep the 2 Hour Agency book free of charge.
              How’s that for the world’s best money back guarantee? I’d say
              pretty good!
